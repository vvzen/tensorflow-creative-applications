# README

This program uses a very simple deep neural network in 
order to generate a color (R, G, B) based on a position (x, y).
You can feed an input image - on which the network will be trained - and it will generate a new image resembling it.

Please run 

```python synth_image_nn.py --help```

in order to see all of the avaible options.
